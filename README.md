# math_game

This is a very simple math game I created to help improve your addition and miltiplication skills. Once the user starts the game, the player has 60 seconds to comeplete the game. During that 60 seconds, the player would be given the chance to answer as many addition and multiplication questions as possible which will be randomly generated. For each question answered, the player gains a point which would be displayed in the top right corner. Once the game ends, the total number of points accumilated would be displayed.
